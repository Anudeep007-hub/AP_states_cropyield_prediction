# Crop Yield Prediction in Andhra Pradesh ðŸŒ¾  

## Overview  
This project predicts **crop yield (tonnes/hectare) for 12 unique crops** across **13 districts** of Andhra Pradesh using **machine learning models**. The dataset covers **2013-2022** and has undergone extensive preprocessing in a separate repository.  

## Features  
- **Enhanced Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors** for improved accuracy.  
- **Flask-based UI** (`ap.py`) for user interaction.  
- **Comprehensive data preprocessing** (handled in a separate repository).  
- **Visualization of results** via generated graphs.  

## Dataset  
- Data collected from **2013-2022** across Andhra Pradesh districts.  
- Features include **Crop Type, District, Season, Area, Annual Rainfall, Fertilizer Usage, and Temperature**.  
- Preprocessed dataset available in [ML_DataPreProcessing Repository](https://github.com/Anudeep007-hub/ML_DataPreProcessing.git).

## Installation & Setup  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** and install dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project  
1. **Train the Model (if needed)**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Run the Flask App**  
   ```bash
   python ap.py
   ```
3. Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** in your browser to access the UI.  

## Usage  
- **Train a new model**: Option to train a fresh ML model.  
- **Evaluate model performance**: Get metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.  
- **Make Predictions**: Enter crop details in UI and get yield prediction instantly.  

## Model Performance  
The **Enhanced Random Forest Regressor** achieved:  
 **High RÂ² Score** for better accuracy.  
 **Optimized ETL pipeline** for data preprocessing.  
 **Improved feature engineering** to enhance model predictions.  

## Acknowledgment  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Done in [ML_DataPreProcessing Repository](https://github.com/Anudeep007-hub/ML_DataPreProcessing.git).  
- **Machine Learning Models & Prediction**: Implemented in this repository.
